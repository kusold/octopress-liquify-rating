### Description ###
This plugin is used to generate 0-5 stars. You can make partial stars, but I only recommend using 0.5 increments. An example usage includes reviewing movies, albums, etc...

* Copy rating-stars.rb into your Plugin/ directory.
* Copy rating-stars.css into your Stylesheets/ directory
* Modify your .themes/classic/source/custom/head.html file to include the rating-stars.css file

    {% rating #.# %}
